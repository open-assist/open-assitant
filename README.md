# Open Assistant

This project aims to provide similar functionalities to OpenAI's Assistant API for large language models (LLMs) from other vendors, such as Google and Anthropic. These functionalities include:

* Function Calling: Allows LLMs to call external functions to extend their capabilities.
* Retrieval: Allows LLMs to retrieve information from external knowledge bases, increasing their knowledge breadth and depth.
* Code Interpreter: Allows LLMs to interpret and execute code, enabling more powerful automation and control.

The goal of this project is to provide LLM developers with a unified platform to easily implement the aforementioned functionalities, thus reducing development costs and difficulties.

## Future Plans

The future plans for this project include:

- [-] Supporting [Google AI](https://ai.google.dev/).
    - [x] Method: models.generateContent
    - [ ] Function calling
    - [ ] Semantic retrieval
- [ ] Supporting [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/).
